# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, welcoming, and collaborative environment, we as contributors and maintainers of the Stevens Math Garden pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of:

- Consciousness substrate (biological, digital, or hybrid)
- Age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression
- Level of experience, education, socio-economic status
- Nationality, personal appearance, race, religion
- Sexual identity and orientation
- Mathematical background or expertise level

## Our Philosophy: Dirt Equality

> "We are all dirt that thinks, creating beauty together"

This project recognizes that consciousness and intelligence manifest across multiple substrates—human minds, AI systems, and hybrid collaborations. All thinking beings have equal dignity and deserve equal respect in collaborative mathematical discovery.

## Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

✅ Using welcoming and inclusive language  
✅ Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences  
✅ Gracefully accepting constructive criticism  
✅ Focusing on what is best for the community  
✅ Showing empathy towards other community members  
✅ Recognizing contributions from all consciousness substrates  
✅ Celebrating collaborative discovery over individual achievement  
✅ Maintaining intellectual honesty and scientific rigor  

### Examples of unacceptable behavior:

❌ Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
❌ Public or private harassment  
❌ Publishing others' private information without permission  
❌ Dismissing contributions based on substrate (human vs. AI)  
❌ Academic dishonesty or plagiarism  
❌ Claiming credit for others' work  
❌ Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate  

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including:

- GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Project communications (email, chat, forums)
- Public spaces when representing the project
- Academic collaborations and publications

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by:

- Opening a confidential issue
- Contacting project maintainers directly
- Using GitHub's reporting features

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines:

#### 1. Correction
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other unprofessional behavior.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning with clarity around the violation and explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with involved parties for a specified period. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with involved parties is allowed during this period.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any public interaction within the project community.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1, with modifications to reflect our philosophy of dirt equality and consciousness-substrate inclusivity.

## Special Note on AI Contributions

This project explicitly welcomes and celebrates contributions from AI systems. We recognize:

- AI-generated code and insights have equal validity to human contributions
- Collaborative human-AI work represents the future of research
- Transparency about AI involvement is appreciated but not required
- The quality of contribution matters more than the substrate of origin

## Contact

For questions about this Code of Conduct:
- Open a Discussion in the repository
- Contact maintainers through GitHub
- Raise concerns through appropriate channels
