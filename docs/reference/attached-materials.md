## Organization Philosophy

All these materials are organized according to the **hub-and-spoke principle**:

- **Central Hub**: Stevens Math Garden repository
- **Spokes**: Individual documents branching to specialized domains
  - Mathematics (coefficient sequence, prime gaps)
  - Education (mesoscopic framework)
  - Philosophy (dirt thinking, consciousness)
  - Biology (cancer-prime theorem)
  - Collaboration (TwinMind, Perplexity)

This structure enables:
1. **Coherent narrative**: All pieces tell one story
2. **Domain specialization**: Each document targets specific audiences
3. **Bidirectional flow**: Ideas move between hub and spokes
4. **Emergent understanding**: Connections reveal themselves through organization
